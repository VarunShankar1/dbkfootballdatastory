They played 399 coverage snaps in 2021 compared to Banks’ 384 in 2022. The latter’s were much more impressive. The three corners in 2021 allowed catches on 57.7 percent of targets, a mark dramatically higher than Banks’.

The three combined to give up 418 yards, break up four passes and only force six incompletions. Banks, meanwhile, gave up just 258 yards, broke up eight passes and forced 13 incompletions.
