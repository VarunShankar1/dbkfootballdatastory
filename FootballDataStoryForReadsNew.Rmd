They played 399 coverage snaps in 2021 compared to Banks' 384 in 2022. The latter's were much more impressive. The three corners in 2021 allowed catches on 57.7 percent of targets, a mark dramatically higher than Banks'.

The three combined to give up 418 yards, break up four passes and only force six incompletions. Banks, meanwhile, gave up just 258 yards, broke up eight passes and forced 13 incompletions.

But Tagovailoa spent almost a third of his snaps under duress and led the Big Ten in sacks taken with 34. Graph: <https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/13527657/>

Tagovailoa averaged 2.99 seconds before throwing the ball in 2022. That mark was the highest among Big Ten quarterbacks with at least ten starts

Nearly 200 of those yards came from passes thrown at least 20 yards down the field, by far the highest mark of any tight end in the Big Ten in 2022. Dyches’ ten  deep ball targets were also a conference-high.

One of the main keys to Hemby and Littleton’s success out of the backfield was their ability to break tackles and extend plays through contact. Hemby racked up 525 yards after contact on the year while Littleton averaged nearly four yards after contact per rush for his 77 carries.

While Maryland didn’t get over the hump against either the Buckeyes or Wolverines this season, the Terps showed sizable improvement when analyzing the box scores for each game. 

Here, I took how much the average margin of victory/defeat for each of: Ohio State, Penn State, Michigan and Michigan State from 2014-2021 and put it next to the 2022 average margin. All of the box scores can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n7QIXsMtkmARjHliLg1RcPNn9-CpEu-W2JO774cO6LM/edit?usp=sharing
